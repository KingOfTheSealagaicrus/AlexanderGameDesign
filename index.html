The game I am trying to make is one that even I am unsure of. What I <p> want for it is plenty of movement for the player, along with presenting an unusual, yet <p>compelling setting that will keep the player's attention. In terms of story, that is something I need to <p> work on. Several thoughts come to mind, but need more time to be workshopped.

level progress continued/homework questions

question 1: "What does the title of the article mean?"

The title basically means as it says, talk less about it and work more on what the game is.

question 2: "Do you agree with the central idea? Why or why not?

I honestly do agree with the overall idea of the article. The reason being that the process 
of making a game is something that takes time. You can't always talk about it because the 
more you do that, the less work you're putting into the game. The same applies with certain 
games, the more the game just drones on and continues talking, the less likely players will 
engage with the game because they haven't played it.
